# DDPM_implementation

## Overview

DDPMs are generative models that leverage the concept of diffusion processes to model the data distribution. This is a simplified implementation of diffusion model from the paper "Differentiable Diffusion Probabilistic Models" as a final project for the course "Deep Generative Models" at the HSE University.

## Code Structure

- `DDPM_implementation.py`: main script containing the implementation of DDPM, training procedure, and sample generation;
- `DDPM_demo.ipynb`: a demonstration of the implemented model with examples;
- `README.md`: an overview of the project;
- `requirements.txt`: list of dependencies required to run the project.

## Acknowledgments

- This implementation is based on the paper [Differentiable Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) by Jonathan Ho, Ajay Jain, Pieter Abbeel.
